# Vehicle Platooning Simulation

## Project Overview
This project simulates the behavior of autonomous vehicles navigating a circular track using COOJA and Contiki. It explores vehicle coordination, the effects of speed changes, and the impact of braking on network efficiency.

## Key Features
- Circular formation of autonomous vehicles
- Gradual speed reduction simulation
- Analysis of braking effects on surrounding vehicles
- Comparison between ideal and non-ideal scenarios
- Communication between vehicles and traffic signals

## Team Members
- Dharini Hindlatti
- Srinivaasan N S

## Tools Used
- COOJA
- Contiki
